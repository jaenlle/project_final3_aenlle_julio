## Resources

### Custom Javascript

The custom javascript uses `document.getElementById` to pick out the `h1` tag on the hompage, `.createElement` to create a new `h2`, `innerHTML` to add the new `h2` content and finally `.appendChild` to add the new h2 to the document. The event listener is `mouseenter` and is added to the id "homeh1". I also used `.removeEventListener` to stop the addition of the `h2` after just one mouse enter event.

 

### jQuery Plugins

* [SlipHover](http://wayou.github.io/SlipHover/) - SlipHover is a jQuery that provides an image hover effect that cover images with an opaque layer and text. I used it on the homepage images. 

* [Textillate.js](http://textillate.js.org/) - Textillate is a combination of lettering.js and automate.css. It uses lettering.js to split words or blocks of text into separate spans for each letter, and then uses animate.css to animate each letter (automate.css can only animate whole words). I applied it to the `h1` for the menu, giftcard, and location pages.
